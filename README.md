# Timer

This is an easy responsive React App built during Henry's bootcamp.

This app works in two ways. One of them is as a counter and the other one as a countdown timer.

It contains a controlled form for the seconds entry.

The technologies that were used are:
![ImageText](./src/img/JavaScript logo.png) Javascript;
React;
Styled-Component.
